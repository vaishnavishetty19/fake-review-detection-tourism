🏨 Fake Review Detection in Tourism

This project detects fake vs genuine tourism reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
By analyzing review text, we extract linguistic patterns and train models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) to classify whether a review is Truthful or Deceptive.
A simple Flask web app is included to let users paste a review and instantly check its authenticity.

✨ Features

Text Preprocessing → cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming.

Feature Engineering → TF-IDF vectorization of up to 5k terms.

Machine Learning Models → SVM (best performer), Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes.

Class Imbalance Handling → SMOTE oversampling for fair training.

Deployment → Flask app for interactive review prediction.
